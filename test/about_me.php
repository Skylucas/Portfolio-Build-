                <h2>- About Me -</h2>
                <p>My name is Dan and I am a Trainee Full Stack Developer at Mayden academy, my hobbies
                    consist of playing video games, programming in my spare time and I have done a fair bit of
                    boxing just to stay healthy but is also fun, as I am sitting down a lot usually on my
                    computer. I enjoy making projects in a team as I have made my own rpg game as a indie
                    game developer with a small team which was very enjoyable.
